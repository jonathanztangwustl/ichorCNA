This is a folder that includes both original and modified scripts for IchorCNA.
- `batch_CD.R`: Runs a batch job to correct biases and output correctedDepth.txt files.
- `batch_ichor.R`: Runs a batch job to run IchorCNA's full workflow (including segmentation).
- `call_ichor_segs.R`: Calls segments from IchorCNA's segmentation outputs.
- `check_ichor.R`: Testing/troubleshooting script.
- `createPanelOfNormals.R`: Original IchorCNA script to generate a median-based panel of normals.
- `indexcov_to_wig.R`: Converts indexcov output files (indexcov.tar.gz) to WIG files for IchorCNA input.
- `plot_sec_seg.R`: Used to plot IchorCNA+DNAcopy results.
- `README.md`: IchorCNA's original README.
- `run_CD.R`: Runs a single job to generate correctedDepth.txt file.
- `runIchorCNA.R`: Runs a single job to perform IchorCNA's full algorith including segmentation. Modified from original to include indexcov_to_wig.R.
- `secondary_seg.R`: Runs DNAcopy segmentation on IchorCNA's correctedDepth.txt files.
